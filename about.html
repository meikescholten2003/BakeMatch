                Welcome to BakeMatch! This website was created as a student project 
                to help home cooks and baking enthusiasts make the most of their pantry 
                ingredients and reduce food waste in a fun, practical way.

                  <p>
                    Hi! I'm <strong>Meike Scholten</strong>, a 22-year-old student from Borne, Netherlands. 
                    I'm currently in my third year of the HBO degree in Engineering at Saxion University 
                    of Applied Sciences in Enschede. For my minor, I chose Creative, Design, and Technology, 
                    which is the context in which BakeMatch was developed.
                  </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                I've known since high school that I wanted to study Engineering, and I previously 
                completed an MBO Engineering program. My main passion is drawing 
                houses, but I also have a deep love for baking and cooking. That's why I chose this 
                theme for my showcase project—it combines my technical skills with something I'm 
                genuinely passionate about.

              <h2>Why BakeMatch?</h2>
              <p>
                Growing up, I gained a lot of experience with baking and cooking at home, especially 
                from my mother. My sister is studying to become a baker, so I continue to learn new 
                techniques and recipes from her as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                One problem I kept noticing at home was that we often had leftover ingredients we 
                didn't know how to use. Sometimes these ingredients would expire and end up being 
                thrown away. I wanted to solve this problem in a practical and creative way—and 
                that's how BakeMatch was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                BakeMatch helps you discover recipes based on the ingredients you already have in 
                your pantry. Whether you have a few random items or a fully stocked kitchen, this 
                tool makes it easy to find delicious recipes, reduce waste, and get inspired in 
                the kitchen.

              <h2>About This Project</h2>
              <p>
                BakeMatch is a student project created as part of the Creative, Design, and Technology 
                minor at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. It showcases web development skills, 
                user-centered design, and practical problem-solving. While it's a learning project, 
                it's built with real functionality to help people make better use of their ingredients 
                and enjoy cooking more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you enjoy using BakeMatch as much as I enjoyed creating it. Happy baking!
