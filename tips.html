                <p>How long should you cook broccoli? The broccoli florets will be ready in about 4 to 5 minutes. Follow these steps to cook broccoli:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Place a pan of water on the stove with enough water to just cover the broccoli florets. Add a little salt to the water if necessary.</li>
                  <li>Wash the broccoli under cold running water and cut into florets.</li>
                  <li>Add the broccoli florets to the boiling water.</li>
                  <li>Cook the broccoli for 4-5 minutes, until bright green and crisp-tender.<br>
                  <em>Tip: Pierce the broccoli stems occasionally with a fork to check if they are done. Don't overcook the broccoli florets, or they'll become soft and mushy. This also detracts from the flavor.</em></li>

                <h3>Preparing Broccoli</h3>
                
                <h4>Steaming Broccoli</h4>
                <p>Fill the pan with about 3 centimeters of water and bring to a boil. Place the broccoli florets in the steamer basket. Covering it will create steam. Steam the broccoli this way for about 4 to 5 minutes until tender.</p>

                <h4>Stir-Frying Broccoli</h4>
                <p>You can also stir-fry broccoli! Blanch the broccoli first, then stir-fry it in a wok with a little oil. The broccoli will be nice and crispy after about 3 to 4 minutes of stirring over high heat.</p>

                <h4>Roasting Broccoli in the Oven</h4>
                <p>Roast broccoli in the oven. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit) and make sure the broccoli is thoroughly dry. Toss the broccoli with 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and, if desired, some salt, pepper, garlic powder, or other spices. Roast the broccoli until crispy, about 20 minutes.</p>

                <p>In the refrigerator, you can keep broccoli for 5 to 7 days. Place it in the crisper drawer and don't wash the broccoli before putting it in the refrigerator. Excess moisture can cause the broccoli to spoil faster.</p>
                <p>Outside the refrigerator, broccoli keeps for 2 to 3 days.</p>
                <p>Cooked broccoli can be kept in the refrigerator for a few more days, but it's best to eat it within 2 days.</p>

                <h3>Freezing Green Asparagus</h3>
                <p>Green asparagus is best eaten as soon as possible, while still completely fresh. You can also freeze it. Here's how to freeze green asparagus:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Wash the green asparagus and cut off the woody ends.</li>
                  <li>Blanch the green asparagus in boiling water for 2-3 minutes and then cool in (ice) water.</li>
                  <li>Pat the asparagus dry and place them in a bowl or on some parchment paper in the freezer. Make sure they don't overlap. This prevents them from sticking together and improves the quality of the asparagus.</li>
                  <li>Freeze them for 1-2 hours and then store them in an airtight freezer bag or freezer-safe container. Make sure to mark the date; you can store the green asparagus in the freezer for 10-12 months.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Green vs. white asparagus</h3>
                <p>White asparagus grows underground and therefore has a milder and softer flavor, while green asparagus becomes firmer and slightly spicier in sunlight. White asparagus always needs to be peeled and cooked longer, while green asparagus is often left unpeeled and is briefly blanched, stir-fried, or grilled. I find white asparagus perfect for classic dishes, and green asparagus is delicious in quick, refreshing meals!</p>

                <h4>How much green asparagus do you need per person?</h4>
                <p>As a side dish, calculate about 200 grams per person, depending on the portions. If you're using it in another dish, you'll find the quantities with the recipe on my website.</p>

                <h4>Can you eat green asparagus raw?</h4>
                <p>Yes, you can eat green asparagus raw, for example, thinly sliced or cut into ribbons for a salad. Tip: green asparagus salad with goat cheese</p>

                <h4>Do you have to peel green asparagus?</h4>
                <p>You usually don't need to peel green asparagus; just cut off the woody bottom (approximately 2 cm). For thick asparagus, you can lightly peel the bottom.</p>

                <h4>What's the difference between green and white asparagus?</h4>
                <p>Green asparagus grows above ground and has a firmer texture and a slightly nutty flavor. White asparagus grows underground and is softer and more subtle in flavor.</p>

                <p>Halve large Brussels sprouts, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast for about 20-25 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

                <h4>Stir-frying/baking</h4>
                <p>First cook briefly until just tender, then fry for 2-3 minutes with, for example, bacon bits or a drizzle of honey.</p>

                <h4>Steaming</h4>
                <p>Good for preserving color and nutrients; allow about 10-15 minutes for whole Brussels sprouts.</p>

                <h4>Air fryer</h4>
                <p>Halve the Brussels sprouts, toss them with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper (optionally with some balsamic vinegar or honey for extra flavor), and bake for 10-15 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). Toss halfway through cooking to ensure even browning.</p>

                <h3>Cleaning Brussels Sprouts</h3>
                <p>How to do it:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Check that the Brussels sprouts feel firm and have an even green color.</li>
                  <li>Remove the outermost tip (approximately 5 mm) of each sprout.</li>
                  <li>Remove the outer leaves if they are brown or yellow.</li>
                  <li>Rinse the Brussels sprouts briefly under cold running water.</li>
                  <li>(Optional) Cut a small cross into the stem. This ensures even cooking and faster cooking.</li>

                <h3>Questions:</h3>
                
                <h4>How many Brussels sprouts per person?</h4>
                <p>On average, you can count on 200 to 250 grams of fresh Brussels sprouts per person as a main vegetable.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Adults: 200 to 250 grams is a good portion, especially if Brussels sprouts are the main vegetable in the meal (such as in a mashed potato or casserole).</li>
                  <li>Children: count on 100 to 150 grams per child, depending on their age and whether they are accompanied by other vegetables or salad.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Can you eat Brussels sprouts raw?</h4>
                <p>Yes, you can. Finely chopped raw Brussels sprouts are delicious in a salad, for example, with apple, nuts, and a fresh dressing. But be careful: because Brussels sprouts are part of the cabbage family, they can cause some gas or stomach upset if eaten raw. I slice them extra thinly (with a mandolin or sharp knife) and mix them with something acidic, like lemon juice or vinegar, which makes them milder in flavor and more digestible.</p>

                <h4>When are Brussels sprouts delicious and fresh?</h4>
                <p>"Dutch" Brussels sprouts are in peak season from approximately October to February. Outside of that season, they're often imported. So, they're at their tastiest and most sustainable to buy in winter.</p>

                <h4>Are Brussels sprouts healthy?</h4>
                <p>Yes! Brussels sprouts are packed with vitamin C, K, and fiber, and are low in calories. They boost your immune system, are good for your gut, and help keep your body healthy. My tip: don't cook them too long; this way, the flavor and vitamins are better preserved.</p>

                <h3>Storing Zucchini</h3>
                
                <h4>Storing Outside the Refrigerator</h4>
                <p>It's best to store zucchini in a cool, dry, and dark place outside the refrigerator, such as a cellar or pantry. This way, uncut zucchini often lasts 4 to 6 days, sometimes even a week, without losing its texture or flavor. It's recommended to store zucchini outside the refrigerator. This prevents it from becoming limp and bitter.</p>

                <h4>Storing in the Refrigerator or Freezer</h4>
                <p>If you've already cut zucchini, store the rest in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap or a tightly sealed container. It will stay fresh for 2 to 3 days in the crisper or the coldest part of your refrigerator. You can also store zucchini in the freezer, provided you blanch the slices or cubes first to prevent discoloration and mushyness. You can then store these cubes for up to 12 months.</p>

                <h3>What's the best way to prepare zucchini?</h3>
                
                <h4>Frying zucchini</h4>
                <p>Cut into half slices and fry in oil for 5-7 minutes. Add garlic and Italian herbs for extra flavor.</p>

                <h4>Grilling zucchini</h4>
                <p>Cut into slices and grill on each side for 3-4 minutes. Delicious with a little lemon juice. Also great on the BBQ!</p>

                <h4>Baked zucchini</h4>
                <p>Cut into thin slices, place on baking paper, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cheese. Bake for 20 minutes at 200°C (400°F).</p>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>Is zucchini healthy?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely, zucchini is super healthy. This vegetable contains hardly any calories, is packed with water, and is rich in fiber. It also contains vitamin C, B6, and folic acid, as well as minerals like potassium and magnesium. That makes it perfect if you're watching your diet, or just want something nutritious that's also easily digestible.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>When is zucchini in season?</h3>
                <p>Zucchini is in season in the Netherlands from June to September. That's when they're at their tastiest and cheapest. Do you have your own vegetable garden? Then you probably know how quickly such a plant can get out of hand—in no time you'll have about 10 of them. Fortunately, you can do all sorts of things with it (and freeze it if you really have too much stock). Zucchini is available in supermarkets year-round, but most are home-grown from June to September.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>Questions:</h3>
                
                <h4>Can you eat zucchini raw?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely! You can eat zucchini raw, for example, in thin ribbons or slices. I personally love it in a salad with lemon, feta, and mint. It has a mild, fresh flavor and stays nice and crunchy. I do recommend washing the zucchini thoroughly beforehand. If it tastes bitter, don't eat it; it's probably gone bad.</p>

                <h4>What's the difference between green and yellow zucchini?</h4>
                <p>I honestly don't think there's much difference. They're both just zucchini, but the yellow variety is slightly softer and milder in flavor. Of course, you can choose your preference. I especially like it for adding color to the plate!</p>

                <h4>Do I need to peel zucchini before using it?</h4>
                <p>No, peeling isn't necessary. The skin is edible and contains many nutrients. Just wash it thoroughly before using. If you look at my recipes, you'll see that I never peel the zucchini myself.</p>

                <h4>What should you look for when buying zucchini?</h4>
                <p>I look for firmness and color: a nice dark green (or yellow) without dents or soft spots. The skin should be firm and smooth. Wrinkles or spots are a sign that the zucchini is a bit older. A zucchini of about 15 to 20 cm is best: young and juicy, with a mild flavor and few seeds. Very large zucchini can be a bit mealy or watery. Also good to know: the lighter the zucchini feels, the more moisture it probably contains. So, if you want to grill or bake it without it getting soggy, go for a firm and compact one.</p>

                <h4>Are eggplant and zucchini related?</h4>
                <p>I see eggplant and zucchini as cousins: both are nightshades (just like tomatoes and bell peppers), fruiting vegetables with seeds, but with different personalities. Zucchini grows on a creeping plant and has a mild and refreshing flavor; eggplant grows on a taller bush and is firmer and fuller. When I cook, I like to combine them because zucchini provides freshness, while eggplant provides bite and creaminess. When I prepare them together, I salt the eggplant for 10 minutes, then pat it dry before frying it until golden brown. I add the zucchini later to prevent it from getting soggy.</p>

                <h3>Cooking Rice</h3>
                <p>How do you cook rice and how long should you cook it? Cooking times vary slightly depending on the type of rice; check the packaging. Follow these steps, and you're sure to succeed:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Check if the rice needs to be washed.</li>
                  <li>Place a pan on the stove and add a pinch of salt if needed. Add 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water per person.</li>
                  <li>Simmer gently for about 10 minutes with the lid slightly tilted or closed. Stir once or twice and check if all the water has been absorbed.</li>
                  <li>Taste to see if the rice is ready, turn off the heat, and let it steam for another 5 minutes with the lid on. If you want to cook the rice a little longer, add a splash of water and simmer gently until the water is absorbed.</li>

                <h3>How much rice per person?</h3>
                <p>On average, you need 75g of rice per person. I use 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water per person. I use a teacup for this, but it just depends on your appetite. It's helpful to remember which cup you always use so you have enough rice, but not too much. All the water will be absorbed by the rice. Or use a little more and strain the rice afterward.</p>

Add a pinch of salt if desired and bring to a boil. Simmer the rice for 10 minutes with the lid slightly open or closed, stirring once or twice.</p>
                <p>When the water has been absorbed, taste to see if the rice is ready, turn off the heat, and let the rice steam for another 5 minutes with the lid on. This is how you get perfect, fluffy basmati rice!</p>

Then, place 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water per person in a saucepan. Add a pinch of salt if desired and bring to a boil. Simmer the rice for 10 minutes with the lid slightly open or closed, stirring once or twice. Once the water has been absorbed, taste the rice to see if it's ready. If you want the rice to cook a little longer, add a splash more water. Then turn off the heat and let the rice steam for another 5 minutes with the lid on the pan.</p>

                <h3>Cooking risotto rice</h3>
                <p>Risotto rice cooks perfectly soft and creamy in about 20 minutes. First, heat the stock, using about 225 ml of stock for every 75 grams of rice. Heat a little oil or butter in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the risotto rice and cook briefly until translucent. Add a ladleful of stock and stir. Only add another ladleful of stock once the previous one has been completely absorbed by the rice. The rice will be cooked through in about 20 minutes. Stir in a knob of butter and season with salt, pepper, and other herbs to taste.</p>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>Questions:</h3>
                
                <h4>When do you use which rice?</h4>
                <p>Quick-cooking rice is ideal when you're short on time and is ready quickly. Basmati and pandan rice complement Asian dishes well thanks to their aroma and flavor. Basmati rice has long, dry grains with a nutty flavor and pairs well with Indian dishes. Pandan rice is slightly moister, stickier, and has a subtle pandan aroma, making it ideal for Thai and Asian dishes. Brown rice is ideal for adding fiber and nutrients to healthy meals.</p>

                <h4>How do you prevent rice from sticking?</h4>
                <p>Wash the rice thoroughly under cold water before cooking to remove excess starch. Also, follow the correct water-to-rice ratio and let the rice rest for a few minutes after cooking with the lid on the pan. I always use 1 part rice to 2 parts water.</p>

                <h4>Is rice healthy?</h4>
                <p>Rice is a good source of energy due to its carbohydrates and contains fiber and healthy nutrients. It's also gluten-free and low in fat. For an extra healthy choice, choose whole-grain varieties like brown rice or brown rice, while white rice is a lighter option that pairs well with lots of vegetables.</p>

                <h4>Can you reheat rice?</h4>
                <p>Yes, but make sure you cool the rice quickly and store it in the refrigerator. Eat the rice within 1-2 days and reheat it thoroughly for a second time.</p>

                <h4>What's the difference between white and brown rice?</h4>
                <p>Brown rice contains the outer layer of the rice grain, which gives it more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. White rice is refined and therefore lighter in texture, but also less nutritious.</p>

                <h3>How long should you boil potatoes?</h3>
                <p>If you put the potatoes whole in the water (without cutting them), they should boil for 18 to 20 minutes. If you cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, it will take about 10 to 15 minutes for the potatoes to be cooked. Extra floury potatoes only need to boil for 10 minutes. These are perfect for mashed potatoes, soup, or stews.</p>
                <p>To test if your potatoes are cooked through, you can poke them with a fork. If the potato slides off, they're done. If you feel resistance, boil the potatoes for another minute and poke them again.</p>
                <p>Floury potatoes only need a little water, while waxy potatoes need a little more water. They can easily be just covered.</p>

                <p>Waxy potatoes are firmer, while floury potatoes tend to break down more quickly.</p>
                <p>Waxy potatoes are delicious baked, in salads, casseroles, or stir-fries. Floury potatoes, on the other hand, are ideal for mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes, or deep-frying.</p>

                <h3>How do you store potatoes and for how long?</h3>
                <p>Potatoes are best stored in a cool, dark place. They'll keep for about a month; you'll notice it when they start to soften. Tip: don't store them next to onions, as they'll spoil faster.</p>
                <p>You can also store potatoes in the refrigerator, but this isn't ideal. They'll keep for 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
                <p>You can also store potatoes in the freezer, but prepare them first. Boil, blanch, or bake the potatoes, or make mashed potatoes. Let them cool completely and freeze in portions. You can keep them for 6 to 12 months. Handy if you want to stock up!</p>

                <h3>Are potatoes healthy?</h3>
                <p>Potatoes are part of a healthy, varied diet. They contain more vitamins and minerals, such as potassium and vitamin C, and fewer calories than pasta and rice. They also contain fewer carbohydrates and more fiber. So don't forget to eat potatoes occasionally.</p>
                <p>Of course, it does depend on how you prepare the potatoes. It's better to boil potatoes than to fry or bake them. This is because of the fats used in frying and baking. In that case, don't add salt to the water when boiling.</p>

                <p>Potatoes are available year-round in the Netherlands, but the season varies by variety. New potatoes (early potatoes) are available from May to July, waxy and floury potatoes from August into winter, and storage potatoes from October to April.</p>

                <h4>Can you eat potatoes if they have sprouts?</h4>
                <p>You can remove small sprouts and still eat the potatoes, but not long or green sprouts. Discard potatoes if they are soft, wrinkled, green, moldy, or rotten.</p>

                <h4>Do you have to peel potatoes before cooking?</h4>
                <p>Not necessarily. The skin contains fiber and nutrients and can be cooked with the potatoes. Scrub the potatoes thoroughly beforehand. If you're making a mashed potato, it's obviously a good idea to peel them.</p>

                <h4>Are potatoes considered vegetables?</h4>
                <p>No, potatoes are not officially considered vegetables. They are classified in the same category as bread and grains. Potatoes contain several vitamins and minerals that you won't find in pasta and rice. That's why potatoes are sometimes considered a vegetable in other countries.</p>

                <h3>How long should pasta cook?</h3>
                <p>Cooking times vary by type of pasta. You can find the exact cooking times on the pasta packaging. Here are some general cooking times for different types of pasta:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Spaghetti cooks for 8-10 minutes</li>

                <h3>How do you store pasta and for how long?</h3>
                
                <h4>Uncooked pasta</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dry pasta (e.g., spaghetti, penne) – 1 to 2 years after the best-before date on the packaging, if stored tightly sealed and dry.</li>
                  <li>Fresh pasta (e.g., refrigerated or homemade) – 2 to 5 days in the refrigerator, or up to 8 months in the freezer. When thawing, you can place it directly in boiling water without letting it thaw first.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cooked pasta</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the refrigerator – 3 to 5 days, sealed airtight.</li>
                  <li>In the freezer – Up to 3 months, sealed airtight and without sauce for the best texture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to freeze pasta with sauce, choose tomato sauce or pesto (cream sauce can separate when thawed).</p>

                <h3>Is pasta healthy?</h3>
                <p>People often don't think of pasta as a healthy meal, but pasta can be a healthy choice, depending on the type. I've listed them below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>White pasta (the pasta we often find "regular" in the supermarket) contains fast-digesting carbohydrates and little fiber, making it faster to digest and less filling. This pasta will keep you feeling full longer.</li>
                  <li>Whole-wheat pasta contains more fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which provides long-lasting energy.</li>
                  <li>Protein-rich pasta, such as lentil or chickpea pasta, contains more protein and fiber, making it more filling and often used by people who exercise frequently or follow a low-carb diet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pasta itself is low in fat and provides energy, but the nutritional value varies by type of pasta. Whole-wheat and protein-rich varieties are the best choice if you want to keep your diet in mind.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>What can you replace pasta with?</h3>
                <p>Do you love pasta but want to choose a healthier alternative? Pasta can be replaced with zucchini spaghetti or pumpkin noodles for a low-carb meal. Cauliflower rice or quinoa are good alternatives if you're trying to eat fewer grains (you can often find these in the freezer section of the supermarket). Glass noodles or gnocchi are also tasty substitutes, but they do have a different texture.</p>

              <div class="ingredient-section">
                <h3>Questions:</h3>
                
                <h4>Does pasta contain gluten?</h4>
                <p>Yes, regular pasta contains gluten because it's made from wheat. The wheat provides its elasticity and firmness. Do you have a gluten intolerance? Then it's better to choose gluten-free alternatives such as rice pasta, corn pasta, or pasta made from lentils, chickpeas, or buckwheat. Always check the packaging to ensure the pasta is gluten-free.</p>

                <h4>Which is healthier, pasta or potatoes?</h4>
                <p>Potatoes and whole-wheat pasta are somewhat similar in nutritional value, but differ in micronutrients. Whole-wheat pasta contains more iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and B1, while potatoes contain more potassium, vitamins B2, B6, and C. Both are healthy (of course, it also depends on the amount), so the best choice depends on what you're looking for: more fiber and minerals? Go for whole-wheat pasta. Extra vitamins and potassium? Then choose potatoes.</p>

                <h4>Is orzo also a type of pasta?</h4>
                <p>Yes, orzo is a type of pasta, even though it looks like rice. It's made from wheat and is often used in soups, salads, or as a rice substitute in dishes like risotto.</p>

                <h4>Can you eat pasta every day?</h4>
                <p>Yes, you can eat pasta every day, as long as you combine it with a variety of vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats. Also, pay close attention to your portion sizes. Alternate with other carbohydrate sources to keep your diet balanced.</p>
